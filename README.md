# Obsolete 
I started this project in 2020, making rather quick progress on it. The basic premise was that a majority of business applications are heavily database driven, and generating backend and frontend code for database driven UIâ€™s, for specific design patterns and tech stacks, can be fairly straight forward to accomplish given information on database table relationships and column datatypes. Due to other commitments however, I had not really had a chance to work on this project for a few years. Then came advancements in AI and chatbots, with an impressive ability to write code. This essentially rendered this project obsolete.


# Codeterpret
Initial development. Codeterpret is a tool that can be used to generate and translate various types of source code output based on a database schema.
- Generate C# or TypeScript Class Models, SQL Server or MySQL scripts from SQL Server Scripts, MySQL Scripts, and my own Quick Script.
- Generate an entire Web API back-end project.

The current development build can be found at: [codeterpret.com](https://www.codeterpret.com)
